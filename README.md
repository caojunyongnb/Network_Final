Electricity plays a vital role in the daily lives of individuals and the functioning of society as a whole. A key indicator of a country's development is its level of electrification, and there is a global goal to achieve full electrification by 2030. Given the importance of reliable energy grids, it is crucial to prevent cascading failure, namely blackout, which can have significantly negative consequences. This report aims to examine the robustness of power grids and propose recovering strategies for improving their resilience and provides insights in preventing cascading failure.\par
This report aims at studying the robustness of the United States power grid, which has experienced several large blackouts in recent years.  On November 2019, a major storm struck the northeast seaboard leaving nearly 2,000,000 people without power throughout United States and southeast Canada \citep{johnson2019} . In August 2020, Midwest derecho caused widespread blackouts for over a million people to go for weeks without power and contributing towards the eleven billion cost of clean up \citep{derecho} . Most famously, in February 2021, the Texas power grid suffered its' largest major power crisis in its' history, from the 10$^{th}$ to the 20$^{th}$ major blackouts occurred with 4.5 million people to have no power, leading to shortages of food and water, causing at least 246 deaths \citep{Texas} . One of the typical causes of these blackout is an initially localized attack, but goes on to have widespread affects on the entire network causing a cascading collapse to the whole power grid.\par
To better understand and defend against these intentional collapses, this report will focus on simulating intentional cascading failures on the power grid, both at the node and edge level. The partially collapsed networks will then be subjected to various recovery algorithms in order to assess their ability to recover and to gain insight into how to build a more robust and stable network.\par
To model the cascading failures, the experiment adopted here will draw on the work of previous studies, such as those by \textcite{wang2011robustness} and \textcite{kim2018}, which examined cascading failures from different perspectives using various attack strategies. In particular, the cascading load model proposed by \textcite{wang2011robustness} will be used to accurately represent the load redistribution in real-life networks.\par
The goal of this report is to deepen the understanding of cascading failures in power grids and develop strategies for preventing and recovering from such events through a network-based approach. By analyzing the findings of the report, it is hoped that we will be able to improve the structural and functional robustness of power grids, identify the most efficient methods of grid recovery after a major cascading failure, and guide the construction of more stable power grids in the future.
