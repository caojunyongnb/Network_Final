# Proposal

### Recognition and Vulnerability Analysis of Key Nodes in Power Grid

This study aims to carry out vulnerability analysis and recognize the key nodes in power grid from a complex network perspective. Firstly, a cascading failing model together with different node-attack strategies will be established. Then we propose the electrical centrality measure[1] and compare it with other centrality measures regarding ability to identity critical nodes. Simulations will be subsequently carried on in case studies (e.g. IEEE 30-bus dataset) to verify the accuracy of proposed metrics.

# Idea





1. Attack the network from two perspective

   1. node

      calculate the centrality[1] [2], and try different attack stratigies

   2. edges

      calculate the load[2], try diff stratigies

2. Evaluate the damage.

   1. maximum connected graph (this is feasible)
   2. load model and do the iteration[2] ( much more conplex and I will check the feasibility)
