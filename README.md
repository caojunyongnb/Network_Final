This report looked into the cascading failure phenomenon, adopted the load model and discussed the effectiveness of four different attack strategies. Later, the results were compared to two null reference models. Then, three recovery strategies are proposed and evaluated. The result indicates the effectiveness of attack strategies vary with the parameters, and verification indicates similarities with ER model. Amongst three recovery strategies, the Degree Centrality one was the most effective one on this dataset. By implementing several attack and recovery strategies, we seek to provide insights into improving the resilience and stability of power grids.
