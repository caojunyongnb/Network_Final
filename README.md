### Ns Idea





1. Attack the network from two perspective

   1. node

      calculate the centrality[1] [2], and try different attack stratigies

   2. edges

      calculate the load[2], try diff stratigies

2. Evaluate the damage.

   1. maximum connected graph (this is feasible)
   2. load model and do the iteration[2] ( much more conplex and I will check the feasibility)
