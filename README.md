# Proposal

### Recognition and Vulnerability Analysis of Key Nodes in Power Grid

This study aims to carry out vulnerability analysis and recognize the key nodes in power grid from a complex network perspective. Firstly, a cascading failing model together with different node-attack strategies will be established. Then we propose the electrical centrality measure[1] and compare it with other centrality measures regarding ability to identity critical nodes. Simulations will be subsequently carried on in case studies (e.g. IEEE 30-bus dataset) to verify the accuracy of proposed metrics.

1. replicate 
2. cluster detection????( such as if this is some country data, can we detect the city)
